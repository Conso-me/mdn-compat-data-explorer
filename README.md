# MDN Browser Compat Data Explorer

This is a Rails app that lets the user explore the browser compatibility data that MDN is collecting in [the `mdn-browser-compat-data` repo](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data).

This is a Work In Progress and may end up going nowhere, we'll see :)

Some ideas:

- See a list of features supported per-browser.
- Pie charts showing the status of features per browser, e.g. "40% of features are listed as supported in Chrome, 40% are listed as unsupported, and 20% are unknown".
